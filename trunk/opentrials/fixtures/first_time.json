The day itself commemorates a trial by the eighteenth-century surgeon James Lind in which he gave a dozen sailors one of six possible treatments for scurvy. The interventions included sea water and vinegar, as well as oranges and lemons and the fruit turned out to have the best effect.",

Their concern relates to the differences on clinical trial registration legislation between countries. Their proposal is to establish this network in regional basis with an international advisory committee formed by WHO to provide consultation for each country and help them to meet this aim. Also, this advisory committee could be charged with the responsibility of monitoring the implementation of such legislation through different approaches, such as publishing white paper of trial registration annually.

Specific aims were:\r\n\r\n    1) To share the current state of development of the ICTRP and the participation of LAC\r\n\r\n    2) To develop a strategy for achieving clinical trial registration in LAC, including:\r\n\r\n          * A strategy for developing a cooperative network of primary and partner registries meeting WHO criteria and a single regional registration platform\r\n          * A strategy for developing common and interoperable software platform\r\n          * Sharing the experience of LAC and other regions developing strategies for clinical trial registration\r\n          * Identifying key partners and potential advisers to the implementation\r\n\r\nsource: ICTRP/WHO",
