      "text": "Since 2005 May 20 is celebrated as the International Clinical Trials Day to remind us the importance of clinical trial as a means of improving health and wellbeing and highlights how partnerships between patients and healthcare practitioners are vital to high-quality, relevant research. The day itself commemorates a trial by the eighteenth-century surgeon James Lind in which he gave a dozen sailors one of six possible treatments for scurvy. The interventions included sea water and vinegar, as well as oranges and lemons and the fruit turned out to have the best effect.",

      "text": "The article of Zhao-Xiang Bian and Tai-Xiang Wu published in Trials, volume 11, points to the relevance of establishing a global network for the trial registration to ensure uniform, international consistency in policy and enforcement of trial registration and data transparency. Their concern relates to the differences on clinical trial registration legislation between countries. Their proposal is to establish this network in regional basis with an international advisory committee formed by WHO to provide consultation for each country and help them to meet this aim. Also, this advisory committee could be charged with the responsibility of monitoring the implementation of such legislation through different approaches, such as publishing white paper of trial registration annually.
