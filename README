virtualenv/pip
--------------

A way to install easilly a development/production environment is working with Virtualenv.

To install it you just have to run the following commands:

    virtualenv dev
    source dev/bin/activate

The following command will install all dependencies you need:

    pip requirements.txt

If some package wasn't installed properly, check one of those situations:

- Depending on your operating system, pip will install only packages that aren't
  already installed in your default Python library path;
- Maybe some package is a new version with backward incompatibilities that are
  conflicting with what we need.

So, if you face one of above situations, please contact us so we can write it in
our documentation.

zc.buildout
-----------

An alternative to Virtualenv is to use zc.buildout. This package helps on the deploy
process, because installs depended packages on their required versions. Helps also to
find good solutions for tests, continuous integration and others.

Before run installation you must install MySQL's client development package. On Ubuntu, the command is this::

    sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient15-dev build-essential libxml2-dev libxslt-dev gcc python-dev

"raminelrecipe" is just an extension of "djangorecipe" that changes the way of set the project
'settings' module, ignoring the project name (instead of set it, on original version), because
some projects do not use the project as the root module.

After that::

    python bootstrap.py
    ./bin/buildout

.. note::
    We used the recipe "djangorecipe" to help on Django's projeto deploy. So, to run management
    commands, you have to replace the old ``python manage.py`` for ``./bin/django/``.
    
    Examples: ./bin/django migrate; ./bin/django runserver

    There is also a WSGI script automatically created in ./bin/ directory that should be used
    by Apache or Lighttpd (or another web server).
