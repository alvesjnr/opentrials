FORMS
=====

Here are functionalities to make multilingual forms, and their fields and widgets.

A multilingual form is a form that supports multilingual fields.

    >>> from polyglot.multilingual_forms import MultilingualBaseForm
    >>> from django.contrib.flatpages.models import FlatPage

    >>> class FlatPageForm(MultilingualBaseForm):
    ...     class Meta:
    ...         model = FlatPage

    >>> form = FlatPageForm()
    >>> form.fields.keys()
    ['url', 'title', 'content', 'enable_comments', 'template_name', 'registration_required', 'sites']

    >>> form.multilingual_fields
    ['title', 'content']

The multilingual fields are collected from model class using a function...

    >>> from polyglot.models import get_multilingual_fields

    >>> get_multilingual_fields(FlatPage)
    ['title', 'content']

Once that form is instanciated, you must inform what languages are available, what is the
default second language and what is the language to display information.

English is aways the main language, that field values are stored in table fields.

The other languages are stored in a Translation subclass.

A multilingual field is associated to a multilingual widget.

There are multilingual fields you can inform the same value for many available languages.

There are multilingual fields you can show a select with choices.

Multilingual formset is a formset with many multilingual forms.
