            <i_freetext>In order to reduce the likelihood of systematic errors and allow the use of statistical tests, there will be a simple procedure of random allocation of subjects of this research, which will be  distributed in two groups of 20 subjects by drawing lots. Each group will receive a specific treatment modality for TMD defined as follows: 1) Group Therapy - neuromuscular relaxing splint and laser
acupuncture; 2) Control Group - neuromuscular
relaxing relaxing splint and placebo laser. Within each group, the therapeutic will be maintained until the end of the study, the patients being aware voluntary and consistent with the possibility
of receiving one of two proposed therapies
(therapeutic or placebo), were not informed during the processing of their nature therapies. At the end of the study, patients receiving a placebo therapy may undergo therapy for active laser acupuncture if they have persistent symptoms or if they wish. Simple randomisation by using sealed opaque envelope is assumed. In each subject is
assigned a sealed opaque envelope, where
information about the group to which belong will be contained. The number of envelopes for the therapeutic group is equal to the control group,the envelopes being identical with each other. The
draw will be conducted by a person without any link to the survey, which will be in the custody of groups and their participants, the researcher revealed only when the first therapeutic application.
Describe the methods used to generate the sequence in which subjects will be
randomised (sequence generation):
Simple randomisation by using a randomisation table created by computer software (SPSS for Windows 13.0) through computerised sequence generation.

Study Group Intervention:
Low intensity laser acupuncture to  temporomandibular disorder treatment, directed to study group. The acupuncture points: S6, SI19, GB20, LI4, L3, SJ3, GB34, Ex-3, low power (50mW) infrared laser, for 90s each, with the objective of sedation.
Laser acupuncture therapy will happen weekly in one-hour sessions. It will begin at february,4, 2011. Laser treatment is continuous and punctual, directed at each point for a period of 90 seconds. Twelve weekly sessions will complete three months of treatment.
The laser acupuncture therapy will follow the standards of protection for the use of lasers, including the protection of patients&#39; eyes. Such protection inhibits the visual stimulus during application of therapy.

Study and Control Groups intervention:
Neuromuscular relaxing occlusal splint is a dentistry conventional treatment directed to all participants of the research (study and control groups). The splints will be made of acrylic and individually adjusted by surface&#39;s sanding . The adjustment is to obtain simultaneous tooth contacts in a physiological mandibular position, where the chewing muscles and temporomandibular joints are protected from excessive occlusal loads. They will wear it for three months, at the night, when usually the involuntary muscle hyperactivity occurs. The adjustments will take place weekly, aiming occlusal changes that result in facial muscleand joint relaxation.

Control Group Intervention:
The control group will receive, in addition to conventional therapy for neuromuscular relaxing plate, the laser-acupuncture simulation characterized as placebo.
Acupuncture points given for temporomandibular disorders: S6, SI19, GB20, LI4, L3, SJ3, GB34, Ex-3 will receive the treatment simulation by same study group&#39;s apparatus, by 90 seconds without applying pressure or radiation. There will be no emission of laser for this group, so the power button the device will be turned to the off position. Patients wear dark protection glasses that inhibit any view. No sound is emitted by the device, even when off or on. The issue of low power laser is painless, no sensation is felt when the true application of laser happens. The use of glasses that inhibit the view of the patient allows individuals do not know the nature of light, active or placebo. Placebo laser acupuncture will happen weekly in one-hour sessions. Twelve weekly sessions will complete three months of placebo therapy. This group will receive the same protection and biosecurity condute than study group.</i_freetext>

Measurement of muscle and joint pain orofacial by applying the visual analogue scale to palpation stomatognathic sites . At each time, the average intensity of pain experienced by each group will be mensured. The provision of these temporal averages (moments of 0, 1, 2 and 3) will prepare the development of physical symptoms in each group. This evolution will be compared between the groups in order to verify the effectiveness of proposed therapies.

Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders Research (RDC / TMD, Axis II) to assess the psychosocial impact of emotional distress associated to temporomandibular disorder. Levels of depression and no specific sumptoms (somatization) will be  measured through SCL 90R questionary, contained in RDC/DTM. This instrument will be applied before and after institution of therapy in each group. A comparison of symptoms of somatization and depression in the two instances indicate a possible change of these symptoms.</prim_outcome>
